# NationalParksReviews

Overview

This project is a National Park Rating Website. The website provides users with information about national parks from NPS API and users can review them like yelp. Users can see the overview, pictures, location, and tuition, as well as  the ratings and comments about any national park. After users log in, they can share their own opinions, leave reviews, and rate the parks according to their own visiting experience. Users can also upload the photos they took in the park and upload them to the website.
